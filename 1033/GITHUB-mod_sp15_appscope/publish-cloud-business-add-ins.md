# Publish cloud business add-ins
Cloud business add-ins can be published to SharePoint for Office 365 or to your own SharePoint 2013 site. After you publish your add-in, others can start it from SharePoint on their computers and mobile devices.
 





## Publish a provider hosted add-in

You can publish a cloud business add-in to SharePoint 2013 using the provider hosting option. See  [Publish a cloud business add-in to SharePoint](publish-a-cloud-business-add-in-to-sharepoint.md).




## Publish to the add-in catalog

Once published to a SharePoint site, you can make your add-in available in a local add-in catalog or in the SharePoint Store. See  [Publishing LightSwitch SharePoint Add-ins to the Catalog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lightswitch/archive/2013/04/29/publishing-lightswitch-apps-for-sharepoint-to-the-catalog.aspx).
